                      GEM(R)/3 Release 3.13 
                        README.DOC File 
                           April 1989

 
This file is divided into the following sections:

1. GEM 3.1 installation and the GEM Setup program
2. GEM(R) applications, which include the GEM(R)/3 Desktop (TM)
3. Font issues
4. Application-specific font limitations
5. Hardware considerations
6. Screen Driver Pack Installation

If you are using an HP(R) LaserJet(R) with HP soft fonts and running 
Ventura Publisher(R) under GEM 3.1, read the GEM 3.1 Release Note to 
learn how to set up and use this combination on your system.

INSTALLATION AND GEM SETUP

Before running GEM Setup and installing fonts on your system, add the 
following lines to the CONFIG.SYS file in your root directory.

     FILES = 20
     BUFFERS = 15

Removing a device with GEM Setup deletes the native GEM bit-mapped 
fonts associated with that device from the FONTS folder. To preserve 
fonts, copy them from the FONTS folder onto a floppy disk. When you 
have finished changing your device setup, copy the fonts from the 
floppy disk back onto your hard disk.

If you are using more than one driver pack disk to add or change 
devices, run a separate GEM Setup session for each driver pack disk.

If you have a floppy disk system and you are using GEM Setup to change 
the screen or mouse, insert the GEM DESKTOP disk in drive A and the 
GEM STARTUP disk in drive B before choosing "CHANGE EXISTING 
CONFIGURATION" in GEM Setup.

The SYSTEM MASTER DISK includes a file named DESKTOP.CPM; this file 
allows you to use GEM software with the Concurrent and DOS Plus 
operating systems. Here's how to prepare the 3.1 SYSTEM MASTER DISK 
for use with these systems:

1. Use a track-to-track copy utility, such as DISKCOPY, to    
   duplicate the GEM SYSTEM MASTER DISK.

2. Insert the duplicate into drive A and type:

        DEL A:DESKTOP.INF

3. Rename the .CPM file by typing:

        REN A:DESKTOP.CPM A:DESKTOP.INF

4. Using the duplicate SYSTEM MASTER DISK, run GEM Setup to install
   Release 3.1. 

GEM APPLICATIONS

GEM Desktop

The GEM Desktop Format command does not return error messages or 
status information. To see error messages and the disk status, use one 
of the alternate formatting methods described below. If the GEM 
Desktop Format command has no effect at all, as is the case with 
Concurrent DOS(TM), use one of the alternate formatting methods.

Alternate formatting methods - you can also format floppy disks by:

-  double-clicking on the icon for the format command file. When the 
   OPEN APPLICATION dialog appears, type the drive identifier, for 
   example, "A:" (the colon is required) in the "Parameters" field.

-  choosing "Enter DOS Commands" from the File Menu; this 
   allows you to format from the DOS command line.

GEM(R) WordChart(TM)

GEM WordChart running on a screen with a resolution greater than or 
equal to 640 X 480 results in reduced window size.

APPLICATION-SPECIFIC FONT LIMITATIONS  

GEM(R) Draw Plus(RM) (Release 2.0), as initially installed, allows you to use 
true screen font sizes 7, 10, 14, and 36 points, and "doubled" screen 
font sizes of 20, 28, and 72 points. If you create more than twelve 
point sizes in screen fonts, unexpected results can occur.

Since no doubling occurs for printers, you must generate true point-size 
printer fonts. As shown on the GEM Draw Plus Type Menu, a maximum of 
four typefaces are available at a time.  

GEM(R) Graph(TM) and GEM(R) Graph MapEditor(TM) do not support 7-point type but 
are otherwise the same as GEM Draw Plus.  

GEM WordChart accepts up to six point sizes and a maximum of 
four typefaces; all typefaces must have IDENTICAL sizes.

GEM(R) Paint(TM) (Release 2.1 and earlier) supports up to twelve 
point sizes for all typefaces combined. If you create more 
than twelve point sizes, unexpected results can occur, including 
corruption of the Style Menu.

PostScript(R) Fonts

To specify a character in the PostScript Symbol font that has a 
decimal value of 129 or greater, add 31 to the value. For example, if 
your ASCII/Decimal chart indicates 130, enter 161.

HARDWARE CONSIDERATIONS

Printers

If your system freezes when printing a text file, reboot the computer 
and check your free disk space. If it contains less free space than 
that used by the fonts you are trying to print, there is insufficient 
space to load your fonts. Free up the needed amount of space (at least 
equal to the size of your font files).  A single floppy disk may not 
have room for all the printer fonts.

Toshiba printers need to be placed into unidirectional mode for 
printing graphics under GEM 3.1, for example, in GEM Draw Plus. 
Otherwise, problems such as jagged vertical lines occur. The 
adjustment procedure differs for different models. Consult the 
documentation supplied with your printer.

You may elect to leave the printer in bidirectional mode when working 
only with text for example, in GEM 1st Word Plus. Printing is faster 
in bidirectional mode, and differences in print quality are almost 
imperceptible when printing text only.

If you are using a serial printer, use the DOS MODE utility to specify
the printer port.  Using a word processor in ASCII mode, add the following
command to your GEM.BAT or AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

     MODE COMn:9600,N,8,1

where n is the number of the port that the printer is connected to.

Refer to your operating system documentation for further information 
about the MODE command.

If you are using a dot matrix printer, you cannot use the GEM(R) Output(TM)
"Copies" option to print multiple copies of ASCII or GEM(R) 1st Word Plus(TM)
files.  Instead, use the "Duplicate Name" option to print the file
as many times as you wish.

SCREEN DRIVER PACK INSTALLATION

To install a screen driver pack:

1.  Run GEM Setup from your GEM(R)/3 System Master Disk 3.1. 
    (Refer to your GEM/3 Desktop Installation Guide for further
     information about GEM Setup.) 
       
2.  Choose "INSTALL NEW CONFIGURATION" from the Setup menu.

3.  Choose any device on the list.  Choose any port.  (These are 
    temporary choices).

4.  Press ENTER.

5.  Next, choose an input device and communications port.

6.  Save and exit GEM Setup.

You must now rerun GEM Setup to install a driver from the Screen 
Driver Pack Disk.

1.  Run GEM Setup.

2.  Choose "CHANGE EXISTING CONFIGURATION" from the Setup menu.

3.  Next, choose "CHANGE YOUR CURRENT SETUP."

4.  Choose to change your screen, then select "Other (Driver Pack)."

5.  Insert your screen driver pack disk in the floppy drive and choose 
    the appropriate driver.

6.  Save your changes and exit from GEM Setup.
