    The following tools were used to create the GEM/3 printer drivers:

		Metaware C Compiler Version 1.4
		RASM86 Version 1.4
		LINK Version 3.61
	

    The make files provided to build the printer drivers will work with any
    	UNIX-compatible make.  They rely on the specific directory structure 
	that appears on these disks.
