  The source files for gemsetup are arranged in 2 sub-directories.  The
first sub_directory is called SETUP.  The files in SETUP are all the 
C and ASSEMBLY code for GEMSETUP.  The second sub_directory is called
BINDINGS.  The files in BINDINGS are all the source files for a DOS 
SYSTEM CALL library.  The directory structure is as follows:

			        C:\
			        |
			        |
                 ---------------------------------
                |                                |
                |                                |
             \SETUP                          \BINDINGS




  The following tools were used for GEMSETUP:
  
  	C COMPILER: 	METAWARE HIGH C version 1.4
         ASSEMBLER:     MICROSOFT MACRO ASSEMBLER version 3.00
	    LINKER:     PLINK86 (Phoenix Software) version 1.47
        LIB-LINKER:     PLIB86 (Phoenix Software) version 1.4
    

  To compile and assemble the source code files in SETUP, run the
batch file called COMPILE.BAT.

  To link the object files in SETUP, run the batch file called LINK.BAT.

  To build the library in BINDINGS, run the batch file called DOSLIB.BAT.

  GEMSETUP reads an input file which contains information about the various
devices supported by GEM.  The file is called GEMSETUP.TXT.  There are two
files in SETUP that end with TXT.  One is called 6DISKSET.TXT and is used for
5 1/4" disks; the other is called 3DISKSET.TXT and is used for 3 1/2" disks.
For whichever media is used (3 1/2" or 5 1/4"), the appropriate TXT file
must renamed to GEMSETUP.TXT.   

    The following is a list of labels used in the GEMSETUP.TXT file and 
their descriptions:


	|DESCRIPTION|	72 character-long description of the driver/device
		This label is used by GEMSETUP.EXE in its device choice menus.

	|SHORT DESCRP|	12 character-long icon label for the device. Used
		by OUTPUT.APP.

	|LONG DESCRP|	paragraph of information (in 72 character-long lines).
		When the user asks for help in one of GEMSETUP.EXE's device
		choice menus, he/she sees this information. Limited to a
		maximum of 20 lines.

	|FILENAME|	12 characters of filename descriptor for actual driver
		file. Used by GEMSETUP to find file on disk.

	|FNT WILDCRD|	Wildcard of the form "*.EGA;*.EGC". GEMSETUP uses
		these wildcards to search for fonts for each driver. Usually
		this wildcard simply matches the extension of FILENAME, above.

	|MOUSE_ID|	Mouse id value for screen drivers. Currently in the
		range 0-10. GEMSETUP patches this value in the zyxg area
		in the screen drivers. 

	|SRC DISK|	Diskette label for disk containing FILENAME. Used in
		GEMSETUP's prompt to the user asking for a certain disk to
		be inserted.

	|FONT DISK|	Diskette label for disk containing associated fonts
		for a driver. GEMSETUP asks the user to insert this disk,
		and then copies the files specified in FNT WILDCRD.

	|SCAN PORT|	Port address value for scanner. This value is patched
		by GEMSETUP in the zyxg area of the scanner driver.

	|SCAN XFER|	Transfer address value for scanner. This value is
		patched by GEMSETUP in the zyxg area of the scanner driver.

	|SCAN COM|	File specification of any manufacturer-supplied
		dos driver-type utilities required by the scanner. GEMSETUP
		asks for the disk and copies the file into \GEMAPPS\GEMSYS.

	|AUX FILES|	File specification of any additional DRI-supplied
		files required by the driver. GEMSETUP will not ask for the 
		disk, but assume that the file is on the same disk as the 
		driver. The file will then be copied into \GEMAPPS\GEMSYS.
		(This facility accomodates printers requiring .CNF files.)

The absolute minimum requirement is:

	|DESCRIPTION|
	|FILENAME|

In addition, any device using OUTPUT.APP (not mice, metafiles or scanners) 
requires the following:

	|SHORT DESCRP|

In addtion, all mice and tablets require the following:

	|MOUSE_ID|

In addtion, all scanners require the following:

	|SCAN PORT|
	|SCAN XFER|
	|SCAN COM|

In addtion, all output devices having fonts 1) with a different extension
	than FILENAME or 2) on a different disk than SRC DISK require:

	|FNT WILDCRD|
	|FONT DISK|
