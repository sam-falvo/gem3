	GEMSETUP gets most of it's character strings from 2 files called:
GEMSETUP.TXT and GEMSETUP.MSG.  The TXT file contains all the choices 
for device drivers.  The MSG file contains prompts, messages, and other
strings used by GEMSETUP.  

	To translate the strings in the MSG file, follow these guidelines:

	1) The beginning and end of each string set is marked by open and 
	   close braces ('{' and '}').  The first character of each string
	   set must immediatly follow the open brace.  The closing brace must
	   be on the next line after the last character of the string set.

	   example:
	   {EXIT TO DOS
	   CONTINUE                                                  
	   }

	2) Above each string set is a message which states the number of 
	   lines that particular string set occupies.  That number must be
	   maintained.  DO NOT add any additional lines.  If after a string
	   is translated it occupies less lines, then leave the last lines 
	   blank.

	3) DO NOT use editors which insert hidden characters (i.e. ESC 
	   characters.)  Also, avoid using tabs.  Use spaces instead.

	4) When translating a line which has a PIPE character ('|') in it,
	   be sure and leave the PIPE in it's original line.  The PIPE can
	   be moved around to any column in the original line.

	5) DO NOT do anything to the lines which begin with AT_SIGNs, ('@').
	   Do not translate them, do not move them, do not touch them.

	6) Don't bother trying to do anything with the lines which say:
	   RESERVED.

	7) The string sets under the @PROMPT_PTR header are indented for 
	   cosmetic reasons.  If more room is needed for translating a 
	   particular line, then use the indentation space; however, keep
	   in mind that unindented screens will look inconsistent with the
	   rest.

	8) Avoid indenting any string sets other than the strings under
	   @PROMPT_PTR.

	   




	To translate the strings in the TXT file, follow these guidelines:

	1) The TXT file is catagorized by hardware types.  Each catagory
	   has a number of devices within it.  Each device has different
	   information associated with it.  The  begininng and ending of the
	   device information is marked with open and close braces ('{' and
	   '}' ).  An example of device information, SCREEN in this case, 
	   follows:

	    {
	    |DESCRIPTION|AT&T DEB Card 16-Color Display (640x400) 
	    |SHORT DESCR|AT&T 16 Clr
	    |FILENAME|SDDEB8.EGA
	    |SRC DISK|GEM SCREEN DISK #1
	    |FNT WILDCRD|*.EGA
	    |LONG DESCRP|
	    Choose this entry if the AT&T DEB Graphics adapter card and 16-
	    color display are installed in your computer.  This display 
	    offers a resolution of 640 horizontal by 400 vertical pixels.
	    }


	2) The strings between the PIPEs ('|') should not be translated.
	   The only strings that should be translated are the strings 
	   following the DESCRIPTION, the SRC DISK, the FONT DISK and the 
	   LONG DESCRP labels.  All other strings are transparent to the 
	   user.  If the 'labels' between the PIPEs are translated, then 
	   the strings under the @KEYWORDS_PTR header in the GEMSETUP.MSG
	   file should be modified to reflect those translations.

	3) The DESCRIPTION strings must not go beyond the end of the line,
	   (i.e. maximum of 64 characters not counting <cr><lf>.)  The
	   DESCRIPTION strings are what the user sees as choices for 
	   screens, printers, etc.

	4) The SCR DISK, and FONT DISK strings must follow the normal DOS
	   file naming conventions (8 characters plus 3 for extension.)
	   These strings must match EXACTLY the strings under the @HLAB_PTR
	   header in the GEMSETUP.MSG file. These strings are what the user
	   sees when asked to "Insert the disk labeled ...".

	5) The LONG DESCRP strings can be up to 10 lines long and the current
	   number of lines used for each LONG DESCRP does not need to be 
	   maintained.  Start the LONG DESCRP string on the next line after
	   the LONG DESCRP label.  These string sets are what the user sees
	   when he pushes <F1> to get device information.
